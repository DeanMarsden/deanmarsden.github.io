					The Blurb
				</h2>
				<p>
					Fired at 48 from a prestigious advertising agency, going through a midlife crisis and longing for some action and adventure, what is Matthew Pollet to do but set up his own company to try and get his life on track. From stress-induced panic attacks to the dangerous sexual attraction he feels for his new receptionist, Samantha, the move seems like an idea for a tragic comedy. But all that changes when Sir James Forrest, the new CEO of London Insurance PLC, comes onto the scene, looking to hire Matthew's fledgling company. 
				</p>
				<p>
					With things on the up, Sir James' true position as the central figure in a criminal investigation into London's urban underground comes as quite a shock. With his midlife crisis forgotten in the scramble to save his advertising agency and halt the sexual attraction between Samantha and the womanising Sir James, Matthew must use all his wits to stop himself being framed for fraud in an unforgettable chase through the urban underground of London and to the Continent, where the criminal investigation comes to a thrilling conclusion. Can Sir James be stopped? 
				</p>
				<p>
					Combining comedy action and adventure, 'The Arrangement' is funny, fast-paced, and perfect for anyone looking for an action thriller with flair.

    				A Message From The Author
    			</h2>
    			<p>
    				I really enjoyed writing “The Arrangement” and I hope that you will find the book amusing and exciting. This is my debut novel and due to the interest in “The Arrangement” I have been asked to write a sequel featuring the same characters that are introduced in “The Arrangement”.
    			<p>
    				It seems strange to sit down in front of a computer and look at a blank page wondering what you are going to do with it and then forty minutes later it is full of words. Isn’t imagination wonderful!
    			
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				Apart from the humour, the drama, the sex and the adventure there are some more serious elements in the book. You will see how I portray greed as an anathema, politicians as inept and bankers and accountants as …well don’t let’s go there.
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				I have tried to include real places and in certain instances real people in the book. I hope they do not mind me using their names. 
    			</p>
    			<p>
    				I would like to be in contact with my readers as far as possible so please feel free to email me at the address at the top of the page.
    				Thank you for buying the book and I hope you enjoy reading it.
    			</p>
